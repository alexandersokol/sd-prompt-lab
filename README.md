# SD Prompt Lab

ðŸš€ **SD Prompt Lab** is an extension for [AUTOMATIC1111's Stable Diffusion WebUI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) designed to enhance your prompt crafting experience. It offers a suite of tools to streamline prompt creation, management, and utilization.

## Features

- **Prompt Editor with Syntax Highlighting**: Craft prompts effortlessly with an editor that supports syntax highlighting for various elements, including:
  - **LoRA embeddings**: Recognizes patterns like `<lora:embedding_name>`.
  - **Parentheses and Braces**: Highlights nested structures for better readability.

- **Autocomplete Suggestions**: As you type, receive suggestions based on prompts you already saved.
- **Common Prompts**: Frequently used common prompts such as masterpiece or score_9, can be updated manually in common_prompts.txt.
- **Unwanted Prompts**: Alerts you to prompts that are commonly avoided or deprecated, can be updated in unwanted_prompts.txt.

- **Prompt Management**: Save, edit, and organize your prompts within the extension for easy access and reuse.

- **Wildcards Integration**: Navigate and manage your wildcards seamlessly within the extension. *Note*: This feature requires the [Dynamic Prompts](https://github.com/adieyal/sd-dynamic-prompts) extension to be installed and enabled, and wildcards files added.

- **Image Handling in 'Create' Tab**:
  - **Local Images**: Browse and select images from your local storage.
